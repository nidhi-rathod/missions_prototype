# The Raven: India’s Space Education Hub & Mission Stories

### Introduction

**Raven** is a prototype web application that brings India’s space achievements to life. It is designed to make the missions, technology, and history of **ISRO** accessible and engaging through interactive, story-driven visuals. The platform uses immersive elements like a **3D orbital tracker** and simplified mission explainers to help students and space enthusiasts easily grasp complex concepts such as **orbital mechanics**, **rocket engineering**, and **mission trajectories**.

### Key Features
**Interactive 3D Orbital Tracking**: Experience a real-time simulation of a satellite orbiting Earth using **Three.js**, complete with smooth camera controls.

**Dynamic Mission Storylines**: Explore ISRO’s milestones through a clean tabbed interface featuring missions like **Chandrayaan-3**, **Mangalyaan**, and **Gaganyaan**, with technical details simplified for learners.

**Educational Focus Metrics**: Every mission highlights core learning aspects — **Trajectory**, **Engineering**, **History**, and **Objectives** — making it ideal for students and educators.

**Rocket Builder**: A concept section for a future **drag-and-drop rocket simulator**, designed to teach principles like mass, thrust, and multi-stage construction interactively.

### Technology Stack

                                       
Frontend: HTML5 + JavaScript                       
Styling: Tailwind CSS 
3D Visualization: Three.js orbital simulation                    

### Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
**Physics-Based Rocket Simulator**: Integrate real thrust, mass, and stage equations for a hands-on launch simulation.

**Enhanced 3D Environment**: Add high-resolution Earth textures, realistic satellite models, and mock telemetry readouts.

**Mission Timelines**: Visualize key events — insertion burns, orbit maneuvers, module separations — in interactive chronological order.

**Backend Integration**: Connect with **Firebase/Firestore** to save user-built rockets, progress, and learning achievements.
